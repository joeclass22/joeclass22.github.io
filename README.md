## About Me
I'm a 2nd year PhD student in linguistics at UCLA. My primary research interest is natural language syntax and its interface with morphology. Within this domain, I often find myself focusing on agreement and its relationship with case. I work on a variety of languages, including Basque, Tlingit, Southern Tiwa and Gujarati. My work is set largely within the frameworks of Minimalism and Distributed Morphology (although you could probably convince me to do Nanosyntax as well).
